This repo contains code snippets for reproducing the plots in the blog post.

Note that we utilize [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) to provide
the package environment, which also encapsulates the correct TensorFlow version.

Upon cloning the repo, the code to produce the plots can be found in `R/explain.R`.
